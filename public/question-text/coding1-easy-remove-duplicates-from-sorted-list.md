Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, *delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once*. Return *the linked list **sorted** as well*. 

The structure of linked-list is provided in the right panel. **Please DO NOT modify the linked-list.**

**Example 1:**

Output: [1,2,3]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- The list is guaranteed to be **sorted** in ascending order.
